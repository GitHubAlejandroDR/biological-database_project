# Biological Database Design Using Multi-source Integration

## Description

For this project, three different data models using MySql, XML and Mongo DB are proposed for a biological database. The biological database model integrates data from The National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and National Institute of Health Clinical Trials (NHI). In addition, a set of queries in the three data models is provided. Query optimization is performed in MySql. A simple Python script is used for data insertion into the XML model.
